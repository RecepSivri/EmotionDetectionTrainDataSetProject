# EmotionDetectionTrainDataSetProject #
* This project is part of my graduation project which is Emotion detection from human facial expression.
* I train system using jaffe data set.
*  Use weka project to train system.
* To describing images (jaffe dataset and source image from camera) use lbp(local binary pattern) and its
derivatives (local ternary pattern, uniform local binary pattern and local directional pattern).
* I train data set with cross validation in train.java class( one selected women's pictures test system and other women's pictures used train system.)
* To provide %80 success rate I try another lbp derivates. so I get those success rates in below:
